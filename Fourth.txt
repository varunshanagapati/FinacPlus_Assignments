Explaination:
Data Sources: Various external sources providing asset price data.

Data Integration: Component responsible for integrating data from different sources and updating the portfolios.

Portfolio Management: Core logic for creating, calculating, and maintaining user portfolios.

Backend Services: Houses the API Gateway, which receives user requests and routes them to appropriate services. Also includes the Notification System for sending alerts.

API Gateway: Acts as an entry point for user requests and forwards them to the appropriate backend services.

Web/Mobile Front End: Interfaces through which users interact with the system to view their portfolios in real-time.

Database: Stores user account information, asset data, and portfolio details.

The arrows represent the flow of data and requests through the system.

The system is designed to be scalable and reliable, capable of handling real-time updates and accommodating a large number of users and data.
